# gog-charted.co

If you're looking for the `charted` README, go to the `charted` [repo](https://github.com/mikesall/charted). Here we'll assume you know what [the original charted](http://www.charted.co/) is.

`gog-charted.co` adds [gog](https://github.com/ajschumacher/gog) as a way to put data into the `charted` interface.

To run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Make sure you have a `gog` server running, point your browser to your `gog-charted.co`, and send in some data!
